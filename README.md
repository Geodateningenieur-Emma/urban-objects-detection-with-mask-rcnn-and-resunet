Deep learning models, utilizing various segmentation approaches, demonstrate differing levels of effectiveness in extracting urban objects such as buildings. In our paper [Local Evaluation of Large-scale Remote Sensing Machine Learning-generated Building and Road Dataset: The Case of Rwanda](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41064-024-00297-9), we employed ResUNet and Mask Râ€‘CNN to examine the performance variations across distinct building detection methodologies: bottom-up, end-to-end, and a hybrid approach combining the two. We utilized a dataset derived from models pre-trained on diverse samples sourced globally from publicly available open benchmark repositories. These models were subsequently fine-tuned using a limited set of local samples specific to Rwanda. The building and road shapes generated by our models were then compared to the geometries provided by Microsoft's and Google's global datasets, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of performance and accuracy in the local context.
